# teaching-concurrency

This repository contains specifications and safety proofs of a simple concurrent algorithm that first appeared in the note "Teaching Concurrency" published in the March 2009 issue of ACM SIGACT News: http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/teaching-concurrency.pdf.

The specification and safety proofs are written in several different languages. My goal is to compare concurrency reasoning in various verification tools.
